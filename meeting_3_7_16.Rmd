## Agenda

- Objectives for Manuscript
    - Better communicate the story
    - a
    - Biological insight
        - Send to Ed, Craig when ready for their input.



##  The story (Part 1: Setup)
- There is a challenge in Network Inference
    - NI methods can be effective, but are weak at context specific results
    - Existing NI methods can often perform well when measured against gold standards such as ChIP, but context specific validation is lacking.
    - Inferring GRNs from expression data and then observing differences do not yield repeatable results (see later slides)

##  The story (Part 2: Solution)
- Our method tackles this problem
    1) Our method produces **repeatable results**
        - Strong correlation across independent studies of different tissues.
        - Strongest correlation across same tissues in independent studies.
    2) Our method's results are **biologically relevent** and **independently verified**.
        - Mitochondrial function, other biopoetry needed here.
        - Condor
    4) These results **could not have been obtained** via conventional methods.
        - Differential expression, comparing edges...
        
Additionally,

- For supplemental arguments...
    1) Our method has intuitive theoretical basis.
    2) Our method works in simulations with known drivers of state transitions.
    3) Our method is reasonably fast for high throughput scale data.
