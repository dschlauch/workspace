From Author summary on MONSTER paper...\\
Biological states are characterized by distinct patterns of gene expression that reflect each phenotype's active cellular processes. Driving these phenotypes are gene regulatory networks in which transcriptions factors control when and to what degree individual genes are expressed. Phenotypic transitions, such as those that occur when disease arises from healthy tissue, are associated with changes in these  networks. MONSTER is a new approach to understanding these transitions. MONSTER models phenotypic-specific regulatory networks and then estimates a ``transition matrix'' that converts one state to another. By examining the properties of the transition matrix, we can gain insight into regulatory changes associated with phenotypic state transition. We demonstrate the power of MONSTER by applying it to data from four independent studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and find a robust set of transcription factors that help explain the development of the disease.
