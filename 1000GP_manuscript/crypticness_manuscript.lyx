\begin_layout Abstract
The improving quality and falling costs of next-generation sequencing has
 allowed for vast increases in availability of these data.
 With this increased abundance comes a new ability to investigate population
 structure with previously unattainable precision.
 In addition to the anthroplogical value, properly accounting for confounding
 in GWAS, particularly for rare variants, is of meaningful importance.

 or at the data collection level by limiting the scope of the study to homogeneo
us populations or matching by ancestry.
 However, as our ability to further detect structure increases with developing
 methods and technologies we find that even supposedly homogeneous populations
 contain detectable population structure that may inflate type I error particula
rly among rare variants

 Additionally, the presence on cryptic relatedness presents further potential
 for confounding in GWAS, increasing both type I and type II errors

\begin_layout Standard
Much of the structure identifcation improvement can be attributed to our
 ability to identify rare alleles.
 Rare alleles may be exploited due to the fact that they are more likely
 to have arisen recently and thus a superior approach towards separating
 populations that have recently separated

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, very low allele frequencies are more unstable than higher
 allele frequency, either becoming fixed at zero or becoming more common
 with high probability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study we present a genetic similarity measure that is designed to
 separate individuals with recent common ancestry.
 Our measure has clearly defined properties which can be used to test for
 homogeneity in a population and in particular identify individuals who
 are likely be related in a study population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exploiting the relative value of rare alleles is fundamental to our method,
 which uses an intuitive, computationally straightforward approach towards
 identfying similarity between two individuals.
 Effectively, we give a larger weight to a genotype which is common to two
 individuals if the allele frequency is low among the rest of the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 individuals (
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 haploid genomes), with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 variants described by the genotype matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G}_{2n\times N}$
\end_inset

, we define the weighted Jaccard similarity between two haploid genomes,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{i,j}=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i,k}\mathbf{G}_{j,k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\sum_{l=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{l,k}>1\right]}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It therefore follows from the central limit theroem that in the absence
 of populations structure, cryptic relatedness and dependence between loci
 (such as linkage disequilibrium) the distribution of the test statistic,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset

 is Gaussian.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{i,j}\sim N\left(1,\sigma^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 is estimated by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\sigma^{2}}=\hat{Var}\left(s_{i,j}|\mbox{No structure}\right)=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\hat{p}_{k}^{2}\left(1-\hat{p}_{k}^{2}\right)w_{k,i,j}^{2}}{\left(\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\sum_{l=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{l,k}>1\right]\right)^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This provides an easily interpreted statistical test for evaluating possible
 relatedness between individuals in a purportedly homogeous dataset of unrelated
 individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, this measure is particularly sensitive for measuring relatedness.
 Intuitively, we can imagine two subjects which have a kinship coefficient,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

, indicating a probability of a randomly chosen allele in each person being
 identical by descent (IBD).
 For an allele which belongs to the one person, the probability of it belonging
 to the related person is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi+\left(1-\Phi\right)\times p$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the allele frequency in the population.
 We can clearly see that for rare alleles, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is small compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

, there will be a much larger relative difference in the probability of
 shared alleles among related individuals (
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi>0$
\end_inset

) compared to unrelated individuals (
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi=0$
\end_inset

).
 Given that our method weights more highly these rarer alleles, there is
 increased sensitivity to detection of relatedness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a coefficient of relatedness, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi>0$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E\left(s_{i,j}|\Phi,\mbox{No other structure}\right) & =\sum_{k=1}^{N}w_{k}\left(\Phi p_{k}+\left(1-\Phi\right)p_{k}^{2}\right)\\
 & >1
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, in an otherwise homogeneous population of unrelated individuals
 an uncle-nephew relationship (
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi=.125$
\end_inset

), with 
\begin_inset Formula $MAF\sim Uniform\left(.01,.1\right)$
\end_inset

 we can directly calculate the expectation of their similarity statistic,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(s_{i,j}|\Phi=.125,\mbox{No other structure}\right)\approx2.9
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach is easily generalized to the diploid scenario.
 A diploid similarity score, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{diploid}$
\end_inset

, is obtained by averaging each of the four pairwise haploid 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{haploid}$
\end_inset

 scores between each person's two haploid genotypes.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 individuals, 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset

 genotypes per loci, the similarity between individuals 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{diploid,i,j}=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left[w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i_{1},k}\mathbf{G}_{j_{1},k}+w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i_{1},k}\mathbf{G}_{j_{2},k}+w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i_{2},k}\mathbf{G}_{j_{1},k}+w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i_{2},k}\mathbf{G}_{j_{2},k}\right]/4}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N}I\left[\sum_{l=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{l,k}>1\right]}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G}_{i_{2},k}$
\end_inset

 refers to the 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{nd}$
\end_inset

 genotype of individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at locus 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This formulation will have the same mean
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[s_{diploid,i,j}\right]=1
\]

\end_inset

and assuming independence of each individual's haploid genomes, such as
 in the absence of inbreeding,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{Var}\left(s_{diploid,i,j}|\mbox{No structure}\right)=\frac{\hat{Var}\left(s_{haploid,i,j}|\mbox{No structure}\right)}{4}
\]

\begin_layout Standard
Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project contains approximately 2504 individuals
 with a combined total of 88 million variants.
 To test our method, we sampled 80,000 variants uniformly spaced in the
 dataset in order to limit the impact of linkage disequilibrium.
 Our method was then run on each of the 26 populations in the study as well
 as on 5 super populations and the study as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We discovered that there was great variation in the presence of cryptic
 relatedness and population structure across the 26 populations of the study.
 Under the assumptions that each study contained a homogeneous population
 of unrelated individuals, only a handful of groups contained neither large
 outliers nor heavily inflated numbers of significant results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We defined the presence of population structure as applying to those populations
 which had a median 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}<.97$
\end_inset

.
 Using this criterion, three of the 26 populations met this threshold- MXL
 (Mexican Ancestry from Los Angeles USA), PUR (Puerto Ricans from Puerto
 Rico), and PEL (Peruvians from Lima, Peru).
 Each of these populations are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new world
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 populations which have undergone extensive admixture in the past centuries.
 It is therefore unsurprising that these groups of individuals would exhibit
 the greatest amount of heterogeneity among the populations surveyed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We defined the presence of cryptic relatedness as those individual pairs
 which exceed the cutoff for a family-wise error rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.01$
\end_inset

.
 Cryptic relatedness was discovered in 12

 of the 26 populations using this method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overlap in these two groups may be due to the fact that the variance
 in similarity is inflated in the presence of population structure.
 So it is not accurate to identify cryptic relatedness in this manner in
 popultations which contain structure.
 However, in populations which do not exhibit detectable structure, we still
 find many instances of related individuals in this study.
 For example, two individuals from the ACB population (African Caribbeans
 in Barbados) had a 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset

 score of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.6$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p<10^{-30}\right)$
\end_inset

, whereas no other pairing exceeded the family-wise cutoff of 1.3 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p=.0002\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Using the formula above, we estimate this relationship to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi=X$

is applied for identifying the components of largest variation which ideally
 corresponds to the population structure.
 This procedure first involves the calculation of a genetic similarity matrix
 (GSM) via the correlation between all samples, which is commonly followed
 by an eigendecomposition of that matrix.
 There are a number of limitations to this straightforward approach, one
 of which is that the calculation of a variance-covariance matrix equally
 weights the impact of all loci 
\series bold

\series default
, failing to fully utilize the fact that the overall allele frequency is
 informative of the value of each variant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used the 1000 Genomes Project data to compare the GSMs obtained via the
 conventional variance-covariance matrix step and the use of our method.
 We evaluated the ability of each method to separate the same quantity of
 data into the 5 superpopulations and 26 populations.
 Using approximately 80,000
\series bold

 variants, we generated the two GSMs and plotted the similarity matrices,
 ordered by hierarchical clustering with average linkage (Figure

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both methods performed well at separating the five superpopulations, but
 the our method outperformed variance covariance in separating populations
 of the same superpopulation.
 As expected, the lack of focus on less frequent alleles, which are more
 important for distinguishing recent ancestry allowed variance-covariance
 to adequately separate continental origins, but failed to sufficiently
 partition the samples according to subgroups.

\begin_layout Standard
The first two eigenvectors of the GSMs generated using our method vs variance-co
variance yield very similar results.
 Both methods provide a sufficient separation of coarse-scale population
 structure.
 But closer examination of fine-scale population structure reveals our method
 to be an improvement over variance-covariance.
 We were able to provide a stronger separation of all 26 populations, particular
ly those of recent ancestry.
 As an example, we explored two populations- Sri Lankan Tamil and Indian
 Telugu, which have relatively small geographical separation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, we found a strong case for cryptic relatedness between three
 pairs of individuals, one pair of which (HG03998 and HG03873) spanned the
 two populations.
 Considering that both groups were sampled in the UK, this suggests a distant
 genetic relationship is possible from members of different population groups.

 We find that in comparising YRI to all other populations, the within-population

 This trend held true for all 26 populations.
 For the smallest allele frequency bin, 0%-0.4%, the trend is not as clear
 suggesting that this is the point at which quality control is of concern

The Mathieson paper (Nature Genetics, 2012) proposed a problem wherein the
 case of sharply spatially defined phenotypic risk lead to the inflation
 of association test statistics for rare variants.
 Moreover, this effect was not resolved using existing methods for controlling
 for confounding by population stratification.
 The Listgarten response (Listgarten et al, Nature Genetics 2012) claimed
 to solve this with their novel method LMM-select.
 This method effectively uses a linear mixed model approach but rather than
 use all variants to generate their genetic similarity matrix, selects only
 those which are correlated with phenotype.
 A more recent paper on which Listgarten was an author (Widmer, Further
 Improvements…, Nature 2014), appears to reverse this claim.
 In this paper, Widmer admits one potential improvement, building a GSM
 based on selected SNPs that well predict the phenotype failed rather dramatical
ly.
 In particular, when population structure, family relatedness, or both were
 present, this approach failed to control for type I error.
 Seemingly indicating that their group’s previous claim was premature.
 However, they claim now that inclusion of principal components as fixed
 effects does properly control for type I error.
 [However, I don’t see it demonstrated in the paper and I remain somewhat
 unclear skeptical about what definition they are using].
 (For example, we are focusing on extreme events, where inflation is only
 measurable at 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx10^{-6}$
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible explanations for the test statistic inflation was suspected to
 be primarily due to lack of a precise measure of genetic similarity.
 This was attributed in part due to the fact that linear methods such as
 PCA would have difficulty expressing sharply defined risk regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we found that test statistic inflation persisted even when controlling
 for the exact regions for which we simulated differential phenotypic risk.
 This demonstrated that although proper estimation of the genetic similarity
 matrix is necessary, it is not sufficient to control type I error.
 As we show here, association tests in the presence of properly controlled
 population stratification exhibit overdispersion due to the existence of
 high leverage individuals after adjusting for confounding.

A consistent estimator of rare-allele association in stratified GWAS We
 developed a statistic which is asymptotically unbiased by calculating the
 variance of the observed squared correlation statistic in the presence
 of differential variance for both spatially-adjusted genotypes and spatially-ad
justed phenotypes.
 Intuitively, with uniform variance across samples (such as with no population
 stratification) we expect the variance of the correlation to be asymptotically
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, we have the Armitage Trend Test statistic- 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times r^{2}\sim\chi_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, in the presence of adjusted population stratification the variance
 of the observed correlation is not 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}$
\end_inset

.
 Depending on whether the correlation of the variances of adjusted genotypes
 and adjusted phenotypes are positive or negative we see that the variance
 of the observed correlation is greater than or less than sqrt(1/n), respectivel
y.

\begin_layout Standard
In combination with our estimated test statistic, we propose a method for
 estimating the GSM by using the Jaccard Similarity Index (JSI) for alleles
 which are present in less than 2% of the population.
 Our method is motivated by the plausible expectation that rare alleles
 are more likely to have emerged most recently in human ancestral history
 and thus may be superior differentiators for groups which have a more recent
 ancestral divergence.
 An eigendecomposition of the JSI-GSM can then be used to to identify linear
 predictors of ancestry in a manner similar to Principal Components Analysis.

Jaccard Index vs Variance-Covariance approach.
 Use of Jaccard similarity for rare alleles only in estimating GSM outperformed
 the standard variance covariance approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computation of the JSI for all pairs is computationally faster than the
 more commonly used variance-covariance method typically employed for PCA
 (maybe the same speed?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use of JSI provides clearer separation of closely related subpopulations
 The ability to separate distinct subpopulations with a recent shared ancestry,
 such as Spanish (IBS) and Italians (TSI), is a desirable goal in GWAS.
 Even with 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ST}$
\end_inset

 values smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $.001$
\end_inset

, there is a clear bias when performing GWAS on non-genetic outcomes correlated
 with phenotype.
 The ability to separate closely related populations was found to be a function
 of the allele frequency interval.

Separation of Sri Lankan and Indian populations using the Jaccard Similarity

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plot above shows the relative ability to separate two closely related
 populations based on the allele frequency used.
 We see a monotonically decreasing separation score as more common alleles
 are used indicating that the ancestry informativeness peaks when utilizing
 the rarest loci.
 We find that the estimated ratio of mean within-group JSI to between group
 JSI is maximized by excluding all but those alleles with <.04% MAF and that
 inclusion of higher frequency alleles reduces our ability to differentiate
 low Fst populations.
 Additionally, we find that although rare alleles may outperform more common
 alleles for closely related populations the use of a higher cutoff for
 more distant populations may be appropriate.
 This could be attributed to a relatively greater sensitivity to quality
 control issues for groups which already have a clear genetic separation
 at higher allele frequencies.
 The plot below demonstrates the increased efficacy of less common alleles
 in separating Yoruban persons (YRI) from those populations from other continent
al origins.
 The Jaccard ratio drops at the lowest allele frequency interval, possibly
 due to the presence of randomly miscalled genotypes.
