\begin_layout Title
On the detection of genetic heterogeneity in whole-genome sequencing studies:
 A statistical test for the identification of “genetic outliers” due to
 population sub-structure or cryptic relationships
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In order to minimize the effects of genetic confounding on the analysis
 of high-throughput genetic association studies, e.g.
 (whole-genome) sequencing studies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
 etc., we propose a general framework to assess and to test formally for
 genetic heterogeneity among study subjects.
 Even for relatively moderate sample sizes, the proposed testing framework
 is able to identify study subjects that are genetically too similar, e.g
 cryptic relationships, or that are genetically too different, e.g.
 population substructure.
 The approach is computationally fast, enabling the application to whole-genome
 sequencing data, and straightforward to implement.
 Simulation studies illustrate the overall performance of our approach.
 In an application to the 1000 genomes project, we outline an analysis/cleaning
 pipeline that utilizes our approach to formally assess whether study subjects
 are related and whether population substructure is present.
 In the analysis of 1000 Genomes Project, our approach revealed studies
 subjects that are most likely related, but have passed so far standard
 qc-filters.
 An implementation of our method, Similarity Test for Estimating Genetic
 Outliers (STEGO), is available in the R package

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental assumption in standard genetic association analysis is that
 the study subjects are independent and that, at each locus, the allele
 frequency is identical across study subjects
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "choi2009case,purcell2007plink,yang2010common"

\end_inset

.
 In the presence of population heterogeneity, e.g.
 population substructure or cryptic relatedness, these assumptions are violated.
 It can introduce confounding into the analysis and lead to biased results,
 e.g.
 false positive findings
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "price2006principal,kang2010variance,ptak2002evidence,voight2005confounding"

\end_inset

.
 Given the generality of the problem, it has been the focus of methodology
 research for a long time.
 For candidate gene studies and later genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
 genomic control was developed
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "devlin2001genomic,bacanu2002association"

\end_inset

.
 The approach adjusts the association test statistics at the loci of interest
 by an inflation factor that is estimated at a set of known null-loci.
 With the arrival of GWAS data, it became possible to estimate the genetic
 dependence between study subjects and the overall genetic variation for
 each study subject by computing the empirical genetic variance/covariance
 matrix between study subjects at a whole genome level.
 The genetic variance/covariance matrix can then be utilized in two ways
 to minimize the effects of population substructure on the association analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first method is to compute an eigendecomposition of the matrix and to
 include the eigenvectors that explain the most variation as covariates
 in the association analysis
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "price2006principal,price2010new"

\end_inset

.
 An alternative approach is to incorporate the estimated dependence structure
 of the study subjects directly into a generalized linear model and account
 so directly for the dependence at the model-level
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "listgarten2012improved,lippert2011fast,zhang2010mixed"

\end_inset

.
 Both approaches have proven to work well in numerous applications.
 While the first approach is computationally fast and easy to implement,
 the direct modeling of the dependence structure between study subjects
 can be more efficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, both approaches benefit if, prior to the analysis, study subjects
 whose genetic profile is very different from the other study subjects,
 e.g.
 “genetic outliers”, are removed from the data set.
 The standard practice is currently to examine the eigenvalue plots visually
 and to identify outliers by personal judgment on how far study subjects
 are from the “clouds” of study subjects.
 As typically up to 10 eigenvectors have to be considered, this process
 of identifying outliers can become a complicated and subjective procedure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many methods for exist for inferring relatedness which make the strong assumptio
n of population homogeneity
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "purcell2007plink,yang2010common,kang2010variance,choi2009case"

\end_inset

.
 These methods have been shown to be biased in the context of population
 heterogeneity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "manichaikul2010robust"

\end_inset

.
 More recently, methods have been developed recently which attempt to estimate
 relatedness with population structure 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "thornton2012estimating,manichaikul2010robust"

\end_inset

.
 These developments improve the ability to detect existing pedigrees, which
 can aid in the removal of individuals who violate homogeneity.
 However, there is currently no quantitative measure of homogeneity which
 can be used to test a dataset prior to the application of GWAS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this communication, we propose a formal statistical test that assesses
 whether two study subjects come from the same population and whether they
 are unrelated.
 The test statistic is based on an adaptation of the Jaccard Index which
 utilizes the idea that variants are differentially informative of relatedness
 based on their allele frequency.
 Recent work has shown that the Jaccard Index alone can be used to reveal
 finer scale population structure compared with existing methods such as
 EIGENSTRAT
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "prokopenko2016utilizing"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, the distribution of our statistic can be derived under the
 null-hypothesis which makes it computationally fast, enabling the application
 to whole-genome sequencing data.
 Our measure has clearly defined properties which can be used to test for
 homogeneity in a population and in particular identify individuals who
 are likely be related in a study population.
 Applications to the 1,000 Genome Project suggests that our approach is
 better suited to detect sub-populations than genetic variance/covariance
 approach.
 This is most likely attributable to the emphasis of our approach on small
 allele frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exploiting the information in rare variants (RVs), such as one with minor
 allele frequency (MAF) < 1%, is fundamental to our method, as our approach
 utilizes the features of RVs that they are typically more recent than common
 variants and that many of them are population/family specific.
 Since allele frequencies can differentially confound association studies
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mathieson2012differential"

\end_inset

, we developed a method that utilizes the differential informativeness of
 variants by allele frequency to obtain a high resolution picture of population
 structure and protect the association study against bias due to genetic
 confounding.
 Our approach uses an intuitive, computationally straightforward approach
 towards identifying similarity between two study subjects which is also
 directly linked to the kinship coefficient.

 haploid genomes), with

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G}_{2n\times N}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G}$

 is a binary matrix with value 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 We define the similarity index between two haploid genomes, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It therefore follows from the Central Limit Theorem that in the absence
 of population structure, cryptic relatedness and dependence between loci
 (such as linkage disequilibrium) the distribution of the similarity index,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset

 is Gaussian.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{i,j}\sim N\left(1,\sigma_{i,j}^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Where the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{ij}$
\end_inset

 can be estimated by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\sigma_{i,j}^{2}}=\hat{Var}\left(s_{i,j}\right)=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(w_{k}-1\right)}{\left(\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\sum_{l=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{l,k}>1\right]\right)^{2}}\label{eq: variance equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The similarity index 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset

 provides an easily interpreted statistical test for evaluating possible
 relatedness between individuals in a purportedly homogeneous dataset of
 unrelated individuals.
 Note that this formulation is independent of the samples 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 and depends only on the allele counts for each variant across the study
 group.
 See Supplemental Methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Similarity measure among diploid genomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach is easily generalized to the diploid scenario.
 A diploid similarity score, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{diploid}$
\end_inset

, is obtained by averaging each of the four pairwise haploid 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{haploid}$
\end_inset

 scores between each person's two haploid genotypes.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 individuals, 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 genotypes per locus, the similarity between individuals 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{i,j}^{\left(diploid\right)}=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left[w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i_{1},k}\mathbf{G}_{j_{1},k}+w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i_{1},k}\mathbf{G}_{j_{2},k}+w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i_{2},k}\mathbf{G}_{j_{1},k}+w_{k}\mathbf{G}_{i_{2},k}\mathbf{G}_{j_{2},k}\right]/4}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\left(\sum_{l=1}^{n}\left[\mathbf{G}_{l_{1},k}+\mathbf{G}_{l_{2},k}\right]\right)>1\right]}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G}_{i_{2},k}$
\end_inset

 refers to the 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{nd}$
\end_inset

 genotype of individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at locus 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here it becomes clear that the method can be applied to phased and unphased
 data alike.
 For an unphased data matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H}_{n\times N}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H}$
\end_inset

 contains the number of minor alleles, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1,2\right\} $
\end_inset

, for a subject at a particular variant.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{i,j}^{\left(diploid\right)}=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left[w_{k}\mathbf{H}_{i,k}\mathbf{H}_{j,k}\right]/4}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\left(\sum_{l=1}^{n}\mathbf{H}_{l,k}\right)>1\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This formulation will have the same mean
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[s_{i,j}^{\left(diploid\right)}\right]=1
\]

\end_inset

and assuming independence of each individual's haploid genomes, such as
 in the absence of inbreeding,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{Var}\left(s_{i,j}^{\left(diploid\right)}\right)=\frac{\hat{Var}\left(s_{i,j}^{\left(haploid\right)}\right)}{4}=\hat{\sigma^{2}}_{i,j}
\]

\end_inset

Which yields the asymptotic result
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{i,j}\sim N\left(\mu_{i,j},\hat{\sigma^{2}}_{i,j}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Test of Heterogeneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can test the null hypothesis that population structure does not exist
 and all subjects are unrelated, with respect to the alternative that at
 least one pair of individuals is related.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{0}:\mu_{i,j}=1\forall i,j\in1\dots n
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{A}:\exists i,j\in1\dots n|\mu_{i,j}\ne1
\]

\end_inset

In a homogeneous dataset lacking relatedness, we consider each of the 
\begin_inset Formula ${n \choose 2}$
\end_inset

 comparisons to be independent.
 To achieve a family-wise error rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, we use the Šidák procedure 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vsidak1967rectangular"

\end_inset

 or the approximately equivalent Bonferroni procedure.
 We reject the null at the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 level when we obtain similarity scores in the rejection region 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R:max\left(s_{i,j}\right)>1-probit\left(\frac{\alpha}{{n \choose 2}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Estimating cryptic relatedness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the measure is particularly powerful for measuring relatedness.
 Intuitively, we can imagine two subjects which have a kinship coefficient,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, indicating a probability of a randomly chosen allele in each person being
 identical by descent (IBD).
 For an allele which belongs to the one person, the probability of it belonging
 to a related person with kinship coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi+\left(1-\phi\right)\times p$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the allele frequency in the population.
 We can clearly see that for rare alleles, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is small compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, there will be a much larger relative difference in the probability of
 shared alleles among related individuals (
\begin_inset Formula $\phi>0$
\end_inset

) compared to unrelated individuals (
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0$
\end_inset

).
 Given that STEGO weights more highly these rarer alleles, there is increased
 sensitivity to detection of relatedness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a coefficient of kinship between two individuals 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i,j}>0$
\end_inset

 with no other population structure present in the data.
 For an individual variant, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, with sufficient allele frequency, the expected contribution to the statistic
 for an allele from each individual, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i_{1},j_{1}}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(s_{i_{1},j_{1},k}|\phi_{i,j}\right)=1+\phi_{i,j}\left[p_{k}\frac{{2n \choose 2}}{{p_{k}\left(2n-2\right)+2 \choose 2}}-1\right]
\]

\end_inset

and the expectation for the similarity score between those haploid genomes
 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E\left(s_{i_{1},j_{1}}|\phi_{i,j}\right)= & \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\sum_{l=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{l,k}>1\right]\left[1+\phi_{i,j}\left[p_{k}\frac{2n\left(2n-1\right)}{\left(p_{k}\left(2n-2\right)+2\right)\left(p_{k}\left(2n-2\right)+1\right)}-1\right]\right]}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\sum_{l=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{l,k}>1\right]}\label{eq: Expected with kinship}
\end{align}

\end_inset

It can be seen that in the presence of cryptic relatedness, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i,j}>0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(s_{i_{1},j_{1}}|\phi_{i,j}>0\right)>1
\]

\end_inset

With 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{i,k}$
\end_inset

 as the maximum likelihood estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}n$
\end_inset

, by the invariance principle, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

 is a consistent estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{{2n \choose 2}}{{p_{k}\left(2n-2\right)+2 \choose 2}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This yields a maximum likelihood estimate of this kinship defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi}_{i,j}=\frac{s_{i,j}-1}{\left[\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\hat{p_{k}}w_{k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\sum_{l=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{l,k}>1\right]}-1\right]}\label{Estimated Kinship}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{Var}\left(\hat{\phi}_{i,j}\right)=\frac{\hat{\sigma_{i,j}^{2}}}{\left[\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\hat{p_{k}}w_{k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}I\left[\sum_{l=1}^{2n}\mathbf{G}_{l,k}>1\right]}-1\right]^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, in an otherwise homogeneous study group of unrelated individuals
 a pair of cousins 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\phi=.0625\right)$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $MAF\sim Uniform\left(.02,.1\right)$
\end_inset

 we can directly calculate the expectation of their similarity statistic,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(s_{i,j}|\phi=.0625,\mbox{No other structure}\right)\approx2.19
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Statistical power to detect outliers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The properties of this similarity measure lend themselves toward straightforward
 power calculations.
 It is often of interest to consider some coefficient of relatedness, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 that is acceptable for a study.
 Setting a 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\ge\gamma$
\end_inset

 allows for the calculation of the probability of obtaining a pair of samples
 inside the rejection region given two unacceptably closely related individuals.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P\left(Reject\,H_{0}|\phi_{i,j}=\gamma\right)=\alpha+\left(1-\alpha\right)\left(1-\Phi\left(\frac{\mu_{i,j}-1}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma^{2}}_{i,j}}}\right)\right)\label{eq:Power}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable.
 Also note that this power is computed under the assumption of homogeneity
 among all unrelated individuals, which will yield a conservative estimate
 of probability of rejection.
 The presence of unknown population structure will necessarily increase
 the power of the test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is of interest in any study seeking to quantitatively demonstrate the
 homogeneity of participants to produce this statistic which can demonstrate
 that heterogeneity would have been observed with some probability, given
 the presence of some specified degree of relatedness, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Simulations demonstrate power to detect heterogeneity and speed of method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We ran STEGO on simulated genotypes derived from a homogeneous dataset containin
g varying degrees of relatedness.
 A homogenized version of a real dataset was generated by randomly resampling
 each variant across all samples.
 This eliminates correlations between individuals and variants, preserving
 only the allele frequency distribution.
 To test the power of our method to identify relatedness we generated an
 additional sample, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{N+1}$
\end_inset

 which was related to an arbitrarily chosen individual, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{N}$
\end_inset

, in the homogenized dataset.
 The genotype for 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{N+1}$
\end_inset

 was generated by assigning one of their values for each allele to be the
 same as one of the alleles of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{N}$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $4\phi$
\end_inset

 and assigning the other to be a randomly chosen allele across all samples.
 With probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-4\phi$
\end_inset

, both haplotypes for 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{N+1}$
\end_inset

 were selected randomly from the homogenized data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For variant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, allele 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, the genotype at 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{N+1,i,j}$
\end_inset

 is given as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{N+1,i,j}=\begin{cases}
S_{N,i,1} & \mbox{with probability }\phi+\frac{1-2\phi}{2N}\\
S_{N,i,2} & \mbox{with probability }\phi+\frac{1-2\phi}{2N}\\
S_{1,i,1} & \mbox{with probability }\frac{1-2\phi}{2N}\\
\vdots & \vdots\\
S_{N-1,i,2} & \mbox{with probability }\frac{1-2\phi}{2N}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

For each coefficient of kinship we simulated 1,000 studies containing 301
 individuals across 100,000 variants in the above manner to evaluate the
 power of STEGO.
 Each simulated study contained only a single related pair with relatedness,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, among an otherwise homogeneous dataset.
 We demonstrate that under the null hypothesis, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:\phi=0$
\end_inset

, the family-wise type I error rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.05$
\end_inset

 is preserved.
 We then compared the proportion of simulated studies which were found to
 have significantly related pairs to the analytically derived probability
 of type II error (Equation

Of additional interest is the computation time of STEGO in comparison to
 other similarity metrics.
 Commonly, in PCA, a decomposition of the correlation matrix is used.
 We compared our method in terms of computation time of generating a correlation

Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project contains 2504 individuals with a combined
 total of over 80 million variants.
 To test STEGO, we selected a subset of approximately 100,000 variants across
 each of the 26 populations which limited the impact of linkage disequilibrium
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "price2008long"

\end_inset

 and promoted the independence of consecutive measurements (See Supplemental
 Methods).
 STEGO was then run on each of these populations separately to test for
 heterogeneity and relatedness within population groups.
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our investigation revealed a great deal of variation in the presence of
 cryptic relatedness and population structure across the 26 populations
 of the study.
 Under the assumptions that each study contained a homogeneous population
 of unrelated individuals, only a handful of groups contained neither large
 outliers nor heavily inflated numbers of significant results.(Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "population_table"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We defined the presence of population structure as applying to those populations
 which deviated from the normal distribution defined under the null model.
 From Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: variance equation"

\end_inset

, we have the expected distribution under 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 which we tested for in each of the populations using a standard Kolmogorov-Smir
nov test.
 Using a significance cutoff of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.01$
\end_inset

, 15 of the 26 populations were found to have violated population homogeneity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to investigating population structure, we examined the presence
 of cryptic relatedness in the study.
 We defined relatedness as those individual pairs which exceed the cutoff
 for a family-wise error rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.01$
\end_inset

 and were estimated to have a coefficient of relatedness 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}>\frac{1}{32}$
\end_inset

, which approximately corresponds to half first cousins.
 By this measure, cryptic relatedness was observed in all but six of the
 26 populations using this method.
 Eleven pairs of first order (parent-offspring or full sibling) relationships
 were detected among individuals within the same population group, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(.2<\hat{\phi_{i,j}}<.3\right)$
\end_inset

, a set of pairings which corresponds identically with the conclusions of
 Gazal et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gazal2015high"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inference on our kinship estimate is made under the assumption of homogeneity
 of the background study population.
 Identified significant relatedness may be due to the fact that the variance
 of the similarity score is inflated in the presence of population structure.
 So it is incomplete to identify cryptic relatedness in this manner in populatio
ns which contain identified structure.
 However, in populations which do not exhibit detectable structure, we still
 find many instances of related individuals in this study.
 For example, two individuals from the ACB population (African Caribbeans
 in Barbados) produced a 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i,j}$
\end_inset

 score of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.6$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p<10^{-30}\right)$
\end_inset

, whereas no other pairing exceeded the family-wise cutoff of 1.3 (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: All s plots"

\end_inset

).
 Using the formula above, the estimated coefficient of kinship is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}=.27$
\end_inset

, suggesting that those individuals are first degree relatives.
 Additionally, two pairs of individuals in the STU population- (HG03899/HG03733
 and HG03754/HG03750) were both estimated to have a kinship coefficient
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}\approx.25$
\end_inset

, similarly indicating a relatedness of the first degree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, not all related pairs belonged to the same population groups.
 We additionally discovered a pair of individuals, HG03998 from the STU
 population and HG03873 from the ITU population, which exhibited strikingly
 high relatedness.
 The plot below (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: ITU with HG03998"

\end_inset

) was generated by placing HG03998 into the ITU population and running STEGO
 on that population.
 An individual who belongs to a separate population from all others in a
 dataset would be expected to produce similarity scores less than 1.
 However, the similarity between HG03998 and HG03873 was found to be 
\begin_inset Formula $s=3.9$
\end_inset

, significant at 
\begin_inset Formula $p<10^{-30}$
\end_inset

 with an estimated relatedness 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}>.25$
\end_inset

, suggesting that these individuals are first order relatives despite belonging
 to different population groups.
 Both populations were sampled from locations in the United Kingdom, further
 supporting the evidence that these individuals are related.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With strong evidence of relatedness in the data, we sought to test our method
 on pruned data which contained no known related pairs.
 Gazal et al propose a subset of the TGP which removes 243 individuals such
 that no two individuals are as related as cousins or closer.
 These 243 samples include all those with cryptic relatedness inferred by
 the FSUITE and RELPAIR

 This results in a reduced set of 2261 individuals which are assumed to
 be no more closely related than half first cousins

 We applied this filter and re-analyzed each of the 26 populations again
 to test for heterogeneity and cryptic relatedness.(Figure

 in the full TGP dataset were no longer identified as violating homogeneity
 after removal of suspected related pairs.
 However, four populations, including each of the ad-mixed American groups,
 continued to violate homogeneity even after the attempts to limit the impact
 of related individuals.
 The three most significant populations are all part of the Ad Mixed American
 super population and represent

 It is therefore reassuring that these groups of individuals would exhibit
 the greatest amount of structure among the populations surveyed.

 is applied for identifying the components of largest variation which ideally
 corresponds to the population structure.
 This procedure first involves the calculation of a genetic similarity matrix
 (GSM) via the correlation between all samples, which is commonly followed
 by an eigendecomposition of that matrix.
 There are a number of limitations to this straightforward approach, one
 of which is that the calculation of a variance-covariance matrix equally
 weights the impact of all loci, failing to fully utilize the fact that
 the overall allele frequency is informative of the value of each variant.
 Recently, the use of the Jaccard Index has been used to estimate genetic
 similarity

.
 This approach provides a higher resolution picture of the genetic landscape
 by exploiting the co-occurrence of rare-variants in sequencing data.
 STEGO directly utilizes this the differential value of alleles based on
 minor allele frequency by weighting variants by how unlikely such a co-occurren
ce would have been in a homogeneous population.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We evaluated the effectiveness of our similarity measure to differentiate
 populations in the TGP in both global and localized contexts.
 For the global scenario we used data from all 26 populations in a single
 analysis.
 In the localized scenarios, we ran 57 separate analyses corresponding to
 all possible pairs of populations within each of the five superpopulations.
 In each analysis, STEGO was used to compute the GSM containing all pairwise
 similarity scores.
 An eigendecomposition of the GSM was performed and each individual in the
 study was plotted against the top two eigenvectors.

\begin_layout Standard
In comparing our results with those of PCA, we achieve highly similar results
 on the global scale depicting the two dimensional linear migrations of
 ancient human history.
 However, despite a focus on separating recently related populations, STEGO
 is effective at partitioning samples of more distant common ancestry as
 well (Figure

Despite no loss of performance on the global scale, the approach we describe
 here outperforms standard PCA when the task involves classifying individuals
 of recent ancestry.
 Focusing only on populations belonging to the same continental super-population
, every possible pair was merged following the removal of suspected related
 pairs.
 STEGO and standard PCA were then run on each merged dataset and the two
 methods were compared by computing the ratio of mean within-population
 variance to total variance across the first three principal components.

The results show that STEGO outperforms PCA by this measure in 41 of the
 57 possible comparisons (binomial test

) (Supplementary Figure S2).
 We chose a pair of closely related populations from the 1000 Genomes Project
 in order to demonstrate this performance.
 The populations Sri Lankan Tamil (STU) and Indian Telugu (ITU) have relatively
 small geographical separation and recent common ancestry relative to other
 populations in the TGP.
 We used a subset of each population determined to be homogeneous and lacking
 cryptic relatedness as described above.
 We demonstrate the clearer separation in (Figure

) comparing our method with that of standard Principal Components Analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reasoning behind the superior performance in fine scale population stratific
ation is due to the focus on rarer alleles.
 Rare alleles tend to be less stable over generations and become fixed at
 0% with high probability.
 Therefore, rare alleles that are observed are more likely to have arisen
 recently.
 It stands to reason that these alleles would therefore be the most informative
 of recently related populations.
 By appropriately recognizing the increased information contained in the
 co-occurrences of less frequent alleles, we achieve superior separation
 of recently related populations.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to identify genetic outliers has well-established utility in
 genome-wide association studies.
 Many existing methods for identification of genetic associations are predicated
 on the assumptions that population homogeneity holds in the study.
 Checking for violations of these assumptions typically involves a qualitative
 assessment without any specific concern for effect size and power.
 STEGO provides an analytical approach for quantitatively assess homogeneity
 and a formal test for the identification of cryptic relatedness and population
 stratification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several limitations exist with our approach.
 First, the method assumes that the variants are independent.
 We satisfy this assumption by performing LD sampling, but in doing so limit
 the number of informative markers to less than 100k, potentially omitting
 much of our data and reducing our power to detect heterogeneity.
 Furthermore, one's choice of LD sampling method will necessarily impact
 the performance of the method.
 Additionally, with respect to the detection of population structure, we
 cannot design a uniformly most powerful test for structure due to the complex
 nature in which structure can exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In spite of these limitations, STEGO provides a formal, interpretable tool
 which is directly linked to the kinship coefficient.
 It provides a formal statistical test for population substructure, identifying
 study subjects which are related and subjects which are genetic outliers
 in their assigned population.
