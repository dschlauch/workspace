The initial prior network in each of the DREAM 5 datasets was taken from the gold standard, with error introduced (both type I and type II) bringing the area under the ROC curve to $\approx 0.70$. In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sequence motifs were used as the prior with CHiP-chip binding sites used as the gold standard. In each of these tests, measureable improvement in performance of MONSTER's network inference method over the prior network is observed.}}{6}}

Several network inference methods were run on our \emph  {in silico} case-control data.

For PANDA{*} and PANDA{*}{*}, which additionally utilizes motif prior information, motif priors with AUC-ROC of .570 and .547 were used.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces \textbf  {Differentially transcription factor involvement vs differential gene expression in four studies of COPD.} MONSTER commonly finds transcription factors which are differentially involved but are expressed at similar levels across cases and controls. Likewise, differential expression does not indicate differential involvement in MONSTER. For those transcription factors which are differentially involved, but not differentially expressed, the change in involvement suggests behavioral alterations at a post-transcriptional stage. Importantly, the results found in this scenario could not have been identified using conventional differential expression methods.}}{14}}
