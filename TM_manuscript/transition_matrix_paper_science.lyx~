\begin_layout Title
Estimating Drivers of Cell State Transitions using Gene Regulatory Network
 Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Cells are classified by based on their tissue of origin and their particular
 role within that tissue.
 Specific cellular states are associated with patterns in gene expression.
 These states are plastic, changing during development, or in the transition
 from health to disease.
 One relatively simple extension of this framework is to recognize that
 we can classify different cell-types by their active gene regulatory networks
 and that, consequently, transitions between cellular states can be modeled
 by changes in these underlying regulatory networks.

egulatory data, a regression-based method for inferring transcription factor
 drivers of cell state conditions at the gene regulatory network level.
 As a demonstration, we apply MONSTER to four different studies of chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease to identify transcription factors that alter
 the network structure as cell states changes toward the disease-state.
 Our results demonstrate the ability to find strong signals that persists
 across studies and tissues of the same disease and which are not detectable
 using conventional analysis methods based on differential expression.
 An R package implementing the MONSTER algorithm is available at github.com/dschl

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cell state phenotypic transitions, such as those that occur during development,
 or as healthy tissue transforms into a disease phenotype, are fundamental
 processes that operate within biological systems.
 Understanding what drives these transitions, and modeling the processes,
 is one of the great open challenges in modern biology.
 One way to conceptualize the state transition problem is to imagine that
 each phenotype has its own characteristic gene regulatory network, and
 that there are a set of processes that are either activated or inactivated
 to transform the network in the initial state into that which characterizes
 the final state.
 Identifying those changes could, in principle, help us to understand not
 only the processes that drive the state change, but also how one might
 intervene to either promote or inhibit such a transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before modeling cell state transitions, the initial and final cell states
 must first be modelled.
 One might imagine that each distinct cell state consists of a set of characteri
stic processes, some of which are shared across many cell-states (”housekeeping”
 functions) and others which are unique to that particular state.
 These processes are controlled by gene regulatory networks in which transcripti
on factors (and other regulators) moderate the transcription of individual
 genes whose expression, in turn, characterizes the state.
 One can represent these regulatory processes as a directed network graph,
 in which transcription factors and genes are nodes in the network, and
 edges represent the regulatory interactions between transcription factors
 and their target genes.
 A compact representation of such a network, with interactions between 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 transcription factors and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 target genes, is as a binary 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$
\end_inset

 ”adjacency matrix,” in which a 1 represents an active interaction between
 a transcription factor and a potential target, and a 0 represents the lack
 of a regulatory interaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When considering networks, a cell state transition is one that transforms
 the initial state network to the final state network, adding and deleting
 edges as appropriate.
 Using the adjacency matrix formalism, one can think of this as a problem
 in linear algebra in which we attempt to find an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times m$
\end_inset

 ”transition matrix” 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

, subject to a set of constraints, that approximates the conversion from
 the initial network’s adjacency matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 into the final network’s adjacency matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

, or 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{B=AT}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this model, the diagonal elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

 are identity elements, mapping network edges to themselves.
 The drivers of the transition are those off-diagonal elements that change
 the configuration of the network between states.

While this framework, as depicted in

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{fig:overview}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, is intuitive, it is a bit simplistic in the sense that we have cast the
 initial and final states as discrete.
 However, the model can be generalized by recognizing that any phenotype
 consists of a collection of individuals, all of whom have slightly different
 manifestations of the state, and all of whom therefore have slightly different
 active gene regulatory networks.
 Practically, what that means is that for each state, rather than having
 a network model with edges that are either “on” or “off,” a phenotype should
 be represented by a network in which each edge has a weight that represents
 as estimation of its presence in the population.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the practice, what this means is that the initial and final state adjacency
 matrices are not comprised of 1’s and 0’s, but of continuous variables
 that truly estimate the phenotype-specific population estimates of the
 corresponding regulatory network edge weights.
 And consequently, the problem of estimating the transition matrix is generalize
d to solving 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B=AT+E}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$
\end_inset

 error matrix.
 In this expanded framework, modeling the cell state transition remains
 equivalent to estimating the appropriate transition matrix T, and then
 identifying state transition drivers by finding those transcription factors
 with the greatest “off diagonal mass” in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Large values in in the matrix that are found off of the diagonal represent
 a transition in the targeting behavior of the transcription factors linked
 to the row and column of those entries.
 We can estimate the total targeting variation by calculating the proportion
 of the total sum of squares of a column which is off of the diagonal.

MONSTER: Inferring state-specific gene regulatory networks, modeling the
 state transition matrix, and computing the transcription factor involvement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before estimating the transition matrix, we must first estimate a gene regulator
y starting point for each state.
 While there have been many methods developed to infer such networks [REFS],
 we have found the bipartite framework used in PANDA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "glass2013passing"

\end_inset

 to have features that are particularly amenable to interpretation in the
 framework of state transitions.
 PANDA begins by using genome-wide transcription factor binding data to
 postulate a starting network, and then uses a message-passing framework
 to use multiple data sources, including state-specific gene expression
 data, to iteratively update the starting network until converging on a
 final network model for each phenotype.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although PANDA has been shown to provide highly informative gene regulatory
 network models, it can be computationally inefficient when applied to large
 data sets.
 For this reason we developed a classification-based network inference method
 that uses common motifs and coexpression patterns to estimate edges.
 We seek to generate a bipartite gene regulatory network connecting our
 set of transcription factors to our set of genes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inferring an expression-based gene regulatory network: This approach is
 motivated by the simple concept that genes which are affected by transcription
 factors will exhibit expression patterns that correlate with both the transcrip
tion factor and the other targets of that transcription factor.
 We begin with an initial transcription factor-target starting network derived
 from sets of known sequence binding motifs found in the vicinity of genes.
 Next, we calculate the direct evidence, defined as the squared partial
 correlation between each gene’s expression and the transcription factor’s
 gene expression, conditional on all other transcription factors.

The regression is performed m times corresponding to each of the known transcrip

 In this sense, columns in the transition matrix can be loosely interpreted
 as the optimal linear combination of columns in the initial state adjacency
 matrix which predict the column in the final state adjacency matrix.
 (see supplementary materials and methods).

It is intuitive to see that this framework allows for the natural extension
 of constraints such as 
\begin_inset Formula $L1$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $L2$

 regularization (see supplementary materials and methods).
 In this COPD analysis, we utilize the normal equations and do not impose
 a penalty on the regression coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In transitions between nearly identical states, we expect the transition
 matrix to approximate the identity matrix.
 As the initial and final states diverge, we would expect increasing differences
 in their gene regulatory networks and, consequently, we expect the transition
 matrix to increasingly diverge from the identity.
 In this model, the transcription factors that most significantly alter
 their regulatory targets will have the greatest “off-diagonal mass” in
 the transition matrix, meaning that they have very different targets between
 states and so are likely to be involved in the state transition process..
 We define the “transcription factor involvement” (dTFI) to estimate the
 magnitude of the off-diagonal mass associated with each transcription factor,
 or, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

As a baseline comparison metric, we evaluated the efficacy of applying conventio

 Commonly, networks are compared directly, with changes in the presence

 It is therefore reasonable to assume that any reliable network results
 generated from a comparison of disease to controls will be reproducible
 in independent studies.
 We investigated this approach using three commonly used network inference

 - computing the difference in edgeweights between cases and controls for
 each of the four studies.
 Interestingly, we found no meaningful correlation (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}<.01$
\end_inset

) of edgeweight difference across any of the studies regardless of network
 inference method or tissue type (supplemental Figure 1A-C).
 Edgeweight differences, even when very large in one study, did not reproduce
 in other studies.
 This suggests that a simple direct comparison of edges between inferred
 networks is insufficient for extracting reproducible drivers of network
 state transitions.
 This finding may be unsurprising given the difficulty in inferring individual
 edges in the presence of heterogeneous phenotypic states, technical and
 biological noise with a limited number of samples.
 However, the failure to replicate edge weight differences in independent
 datasets is further evidence that we need to rethink how we evaluate network
 state transitions.
 MONSTER provides a novel approach for making that comparison.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each study, we applied MONSTER to identify the differential transcription
 factor involvement for each transcription factor and used permutation analysis
 to estimate their significance (Figure 2, supplemental figure 3).
 Out of 166 transcription factors used in this study, seven were among top
 10 most differentially involved in both the ECLIPSE and COPDGene studies
 (Figure 3C).
 Furthermore, three of these seven transcription factors (GABPA, ELK4, ELK1)
 also appeared as significant in the LGRC results with FDR<.01 and each of
 the top five ECLIPSE results were among the top seven in the LTCOPD results.
 This agreement is quite striking considering that the there was almost
 no correlation in the edge weight differences across these same studies.
 There was significant correlation for each pairwise combination of studies

Overall, we found a strong correlation in transcription factors identified
 as significantly differentially involved across case/control (Figure 3A-3B).
 It is reassuring that agreement is more strongly achieved between studies
 of the same tissue origin than across tissues.
 Each of the four studies was most closely correlated with studies of the
 same tissue.
 However it is quite notable that the we do see much of the same dTFI signal
 across studies involving different tissue types.
 Gene regulatory networks derived from gene expression data are notoriously
 difficult to replicate across studies and it is of great interest that
 we have identified suspected mechanisms which are correlated not only across
 studies but across tissues as well.

 and may play a key role in the alteration of E2F4 targeting behavior that
 we are observing in these studies.
 An additional member of the Sp transcription factor family, Sp3, has been
 shown to regulate HHIP, a known COPD susceptibility gene

 Furthermore, E2F4 has been found to form a complex with EGR-1 (a top 5
 hit in ECLIPSE and LTCOPD) in response smoke exposure, which may lead to
 autophagy and apoptosis, which may lead to development of emphysema

 It is therefore noteworthy that the most highly significant transcription
 factors in the ECLIPSE study were found to be NRF1 and GABPA (FDR<.001).
 Both of these transcription factors were also found to be significant at
 at least FDR<0.1 in each of the four studies and FDR<0.001 in the LGRC study.
 NRF1 regulates the expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins.

 GABPA has similarly been linked to nuclear control of mitochondrial function
 and shares a subunit with nuclear respiratory factor 2 gene (NRF1), possibly
 indicating a role in cytochrome oxidase expression, a process linked to
 COPD progression

 Furthermore, it is established that GABPA interacts with SP1

Differentially involved transcription factors are not necessarily differentially
 expressed.

\series default
 MONSTER commonly finds transcription factors which are differentially involved
 but are expressed at similar levels across cases and controls.
 Likewise, differential expression does not indicate differential involvement
 in MONSTER.
 For those transcription factors which are differentially involved, but
 not differentially expressed, the change in involvement suggests behavioral
 alterations at a post-transcriptional stage.
 Importantly, the results found in this scenario could not have been identified
 using conventional differential expression methods.

Consistency across in dTFI results was not universal for all transcription
 factors.
 While each of the four groups separated cases and controls based on COPD
 diagnosis vs.
 smoking non-COPD patients, many differences exist for each of the four
 studies including microarray platform, study demographics, location, time
 and tissue.
 For example, in the LGRC dataset, we discovered a differential targeting
 pattern involving the transcription factors transcription factors RFX1
 and RFX2 [supplemental table 2].
 Both of these transcription factors transcription factors were highly statistic
ally significant (FDR<.0001) and ranked as the top two results in the LGRC
 study.
 However, their signal was muted in the ECLIPSE and COPDGene studies, neither
 of which identified these transcription factors transcription factors as
 drivers of the Smoker Control to COPD transition.
 We emphasize that significant transcription factors are attributed to differenc
es in the case/control differences, subjecting the results to possible confoundi
ng.
 This highlights the importance of utilizing case control designs which
 are properly matched along known covariates.

Although our hypotheses is that transcription factors that alter their targets
 (and therefore have high dTFI scores) are drivers of changes in phenotypic
 state, many of the transcription factors that we identified are not themselves
 differentially expressed in comparing control and COPD populations (
\begin_inset ERT

ref{fig:expression}

).
 This suggests that there may be other mechanisms, including epigenetic
 and protein interaction factors, affecting the structure of gene regulatory
 networks and that the master regulators of phenotypic state change may
 have differentiated targeting behavior in patients in the COPD group compared
 to the control group.

These results demonstrate the scientific value of MONSTER.
 Numerous biologically sensible results were found across several independent
 studies.
 The reproducibility of the top transcription factor hits is compelling.
 We demonstrate that these findings would not have been possible via differentia
l gene expression analysis or conventional comparative network inference
 methods.
