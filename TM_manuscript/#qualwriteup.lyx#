Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of high-throughput technologies over the last two decades
 has brought significant promise towards understanding biology and shed
 light on the progression of human disease.
 As our ability to collect data has increased, so too have the statistical
 and computational challenges along with our appreciation for the complexity
 of molecular pathways and the biological processes they govern.
 It is due to this complexity that determining the targets of transcription
 factors (TFs) in a gene regulatory network (GRN) is challenging.
 This problem is further exacerbated when attempting to uncover context
 specific network structure.
 Our goals can be divided into two distinct parts, (1) the construction
 of gene regulatory networks and (2) the analysis of the structural changes
 between those networks.
 Due to the complexity of the underlying networks and the high dimensionality
 of typical datasets, these challenges remain open problems.
 In this paper we the explore novel methods developed for gaining insight
 into network transformations between cases and controls in a complex disease.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the use of high-throughput assays, such as gene expression microarray
s, for the inference of biological networks is an active field of study.
 Of common interest is the estimation of the set of interactions between
 the set nodes of a graph, referred to as edges and vertices, respectively.
 Typically, these vertices represent the measured genes or a subset thereof
 in an organism.
 The interpretation of the edges covers a wide range of possible biological
 and statistical interactions.
 A widely used model is the Gaussian Graphical Model, which seeks to fit
 the gene expression data as independent samples from a multivariate normal
 distribution with the standardized variance-covariance matrix derived from
 the network adjacency matrix, which defines the edges between each pairwise
 combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 genes.
 We can then interpret the presence or absence of an edge as the dependence
 or indepenence of the two genes conditional on all others.
 This adjacency matrix may be estimated in many ways, such as with a direct
 maximum likelihood estimation or fitting a regression model.
 However, a significant impediment to inferring network structure is the
 high-dimensionality of the data such that the number of edges for each
 vertex is larger (much larger!) than the number of samples.
 Many methods have been developed to address this issue, often by introducing
 a prior belief that the overwhelming majority of possible edges do not
 exist

key "tibshirani1996regression"

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "haury2012tigress"

\end_inset

.
 This sparsity constraint has been exploited by employing a number of statistica
l tools such as feature selection methods and penalized regression.
 Often for interpretive and visual purposes, these results are dichotomized
 to yield a present/absent indication of interaction between nodes potentially
 losing valuable information for the strength in information and degree
 of uncertainty for inferred edges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The growth of complementary data sources has allowed for the bolstering
 of numerous published network inference methods.
 A semi-supervised learning method, SEREND, was developed to incorporate
 Transcription factor-DNA information, including sequence binding motifs
 in network reconstruction
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ernst2008semi"

\end_inset

.
 This method dramatically improved prediction of TF regulatory targets as
 measured by ChIP-chip data in E.
 coli.
 Another approach to inferring networks was presented by Glass et al, PANDA,
 by modelling the regulatory network as a bipartite graph with pairwise
 connections existing in three distinct sets, (1) within the set of known
 TFs, (2) within the set of genes, and (3) between TFs and genes
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "glass2013passing"

\end_inset

.
 The algorithm finds convergence in the flow of information from the TF
 layer of the network through the gene layer via concepts of responsibility
 and availability.
 This method was a demonstrated to be an additional improvement over SEREND
 in predicting gene regulatory networks in Yeast and has been used to infer
 networks in ovarian cancer

Regulatory network reconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a gene expression matrix consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 rows of genes across 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 samples.
 Additionally, consider a set of regulatory priors consisting of a mapping
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 known TFs and the variable set of genes for which they are suspected of
 targeting.
 Our method builds on the PANDA algorithm by using the same bipartite network
 modelling framework.
 We have developed a novel approach,

bear

\end_inset

), for inferring transcription factor to gene interactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like PANDA, the primary focus of BERE is in learning the regulatory network.
 But while PANDA generates three networks with a clear distinction, BERE
 does not attempt to infer edges within the TF node set and within the gene
 node set, instead focusing exclusively on edges between TFs and genes.
 Effectively, this reduces the number of edges to be estimated to only 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 per gene instead of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 per gene.
 This alone substantially reduces the dimensionality of the problem and
 allows for the use of analyses that may have been unfeasible in a high
 dimensional setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BERE approaches the network inference problem by considering the available
 evidence of an edge for each possible TF-gene pair.
 This evidence can be divided into two components, referred to here as 
\emph on
direct
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
indirect
\emph default
.
 Consider the edge between a TF and a gene, referred to here as 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 The direct evidence, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i,j}$
\end_inset

, consists of the squared conditional correlation of the 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{j}$
\end_inset

, given all other regulators of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the gene which encodes 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{TF}$
\end_inset

 as the set of genes that are also TFs we have,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{i,j}=cor\left(g_{i},g_{j}|\left\{ g_{k,-j}:k\ne j,k\in\mathbf{TF}\right\} \right)^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This calculation conditions only on the other regulators of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

, so it may be permissible to perform with ordinary linear regression as
 is implemented by default in the BERE software, but may also require a
 penalization adjustment for analysis with a small number of samples relative
 to the number of transcription factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use of direct evidence inadequately captures regulatory relationships due
 to the impacts of technical noise and numerous biological external factors
 such as stable or transient protein-protein interactions, post-translational
 modifications, etc.
 which may confound or modify a regulatory effect.
 These sources of confounding and variability in the expression pattern
 of a TF gene may obscure the effects it has on all of its target genes.
 Therefore it is of value if we can complement our estimate of the likelihood
 of a regulatory mechanism by aggregating the information from the gene
 expression patterns of all suspected targets of transcription factors.
 PANDA achieves its superior performance in part by convergence towards
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

agreement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, whereby large collections of gene expression patterns must agree with
 the proposed regulatory structure in order to claim an interaction.
 Similarly, BERE looks for agreement between the gene expression patterns
 of large sets of co-targeted genes.
 We refer to this feature as 
\emph on
indirect 
\emph default
evidence and can achieve this by again utilizing our set of regulatory priors.
 In this portion of the analysis we suspend the recognition of a TF as a
 member of the gene list and instead consider each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 TFs to be binary classifications across the entire gene list.
 Class labels are determined by the presence or absence of a sequence binding
 motif for that TF in the vicinity of the gene.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indirect evidence between the two nodes, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{ij}$
\end_inset

, represents the fitted probability that 
\begin_inset Formula $g{}_{i}$
\end_inset

 belongs to the class of genes targeted by 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $g{}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is considered to be a new observation placed into the 
\begin_inset Formula $n-dimensional$
\end_inset

 space separated by transcription factor targets and non-targets.
 To divide up the space, BERE uses a regularized logistic regression on
 the gene expression data with the training set taken to be all genes except
 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the training labels taken to be the existence or non-existence of a
 known sequence motif for 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

 upstream of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The penalized model matrix comes from the recognition that correlations
 between co-regulated genes will be most strong when the 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

 is most prevalent.
 We therefore use the abundance of 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

 to weight the penalized model matrix, providing increased sensitivity for
 detecting coexpression for those samples in which we most expect it to
 occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To build each of our classifiers we use the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 regularization with the penalized model matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$
\end_inset

, a diagonal matrix with weights equal to the the inverse expression value
 of the transcription factor.
 Effectively, we maximize the penalized logistic likelihood function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}log\left[exp\left(\mathbf{\beta^{\prime}x_{i}}\right)^{Y_{i}}\left\{ 1-exp\left(\mathbf{\beta^{\prime}x_{i}}\right)\right\} ^{1-Y_{i}}\right]-\lambda\mathbf{\beta^{\prime}Q\beta}
\]

\end_inset

This computation is run using the R package 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

penalized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with the penalty term
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 estimated via 5 fold cross validation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By scoring each gene according to the strength of indirect evidence for
 a regulatory response to each of the TFs, we can combine this with the
 direct evidence of regulation (squared conditional correlation of expression
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $gene_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{i}$
\end_inset

).
 The appropriate manner in which to combine direct and indirect evidence
 remains an open question.
 Though both measures are bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 their interpretation is quite different.
 The direct evidence can be considered in terms of it's conditional gene
 expression 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 between nodes, while the indirect evidence is interpreted as a probability.
 For example, under the null hypotheses of no interaction between 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

, we have the known distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i,j}\sim Beta\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{n-m}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, but the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i,j}$
\end_inset

 remains a function of the classification partition formed between expression
 patterns of targets and non-targets.
 It is therefore appropriate to use a non-parametric approach to combine
 evidence.
 The targets of each TF are then ranked and combined as a weighted sum,
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\left(1-\alpha\right)\left[rank\left(d_{i}\right)\right]+\alpha\left[rank\left(e_{i}\right)\right]$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\left\{ 1,\dots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Our choice of the weight 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 here is based on empirical evaluation and perhaps not surprisingly is loosely
 correlated with organism complexity.
 In validation sets from Yeast, the optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 was observed near 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.9$
\end_inset

 while simpler E.
 coli datasets saw an optimal value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.6$
\end_inset

 and in silico data optimality was achieved at 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha<.5$
\end_inset

.
 This naturally reflects the fact that the increased complexity of the network
 necessitates the use of larger scale agreement between genes, rather than
 a reliance on pairwise correlations between potentially noisier and more
 complex expression patterns.

\begin_layout Subsection
Transition analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A primary purpose of reconstructing GRNs is the understanding of the biological
 mechanisms which characterize disease.
 Identifying differential TF targeting may suggest a therapeutic target,
 uncover a disease substructure or identify biomarkers for early detection.
 However, significant limitations exist with respect to generating reliable
 context-specific GRNs.
 Substantial advances have been made in this area with algorithms like SEREND
 and PANDA, but these methods rely more heavily on the static sequence motif
 data rather than gene expression data collected across groups, such as
 in a case-control study.
 Both methods, along with BERE, use gene expression data as a refinement
 of the more accurate motif priors.
 It is therefore a side effect that any GRN inference method that relies
 on motifs directly for edgeweight calculation will be susceptible to having
 the bulk of its predictive power stripped when making comparisons between
 networks.
 Consequently, it is of critical importance to choose a network inference
 method that uses the context-specific data to most accurately refine above
 what information is gleaned from our static data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The task of identifying meaningful network transitions then becomes an evaluatio
n of the relative refinement of edgeweights.
 Since the majority of the predictive power for each edge is contained in
 the motif contribution, we are left with relative edgeweight refinement
 that have a low signal, high noise.
 In other words, we have a very large number of individually unreliable
 edgeweights.
 In effort to extract the maximum effect, we seek to combine the information
 contained in each edge via a novel dimension reduction approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider two adjacency matrices, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

 representing the two GRNs estimated from a case-control study.
 Each matrix has dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p\times m\right)$
\end_inset

 representing the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 genes targeted by 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 TFs.
 We seek a matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{AT}+\mathbf{E}
\]

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

 is our error matrix, which we want to minimize.
 Intuitively, we may frame this as a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 independent regression problems, where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the number of transcription factors and also the column rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B},\mathbf{T}\, and\,\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

.
 For a column in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}_{i}$
\end_inset

, we note that a corresponding column in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tau}_{i}$
\end_inset

, represents the OLS solution to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[\mathbf{b}_{i}\right]=\tau_{i1}\mathbf{a}_{1i}+\tau_{i2}\mathbf{a}_{2i}+\dots+\tau_{im}\mathbf{a}_{mi}
\]

\end_inset

or alternatively expressed 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{b}_{i1}\\
\mathbf{b}_{i2}\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{b}_{ip}
\end{array}\right]=\mathbf{\tau}_{1,i}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{a}_{11}\\
\mathbf{a}_{21}\\

\mathbf{a}_{p1}
\end{array}\right]+\mathbf{\tau}_{2,i}\left[\begin{array}{c}

\end{array}\right]+\dots+\mathbf{\tau}_{p,i}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{a}_{1p}\\
\mathbf{a}_{2p}\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{a}_{pp}
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
e_{i1}\\
e_{i2}\\
\vdots\\
e_{ip}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left[e_{ij}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be solved with normal equations, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{\tau}_{i} & = & \left(\mathbf{A}^{T}\mathbf{A}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{A}^{T}\mathbf{b}_{i}\\
\mathbf{T} & = & \left[\tau_{1},\tau_{2},\dots,\tau_{n}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Which produces the least square estimate.
 I.e.
 loss function 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\mathbf{T}\right)=\sum_{gene=1}^{N}||\mathbf{B}_{gene}-\mathbf{A}_{gene}\mathbf{T}||^{2}$
\end_inset

 is minimized.
 We further extend this method to include a penalty term
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "tibshirani1996regression"

\end_inset

.
 An 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 regularization is used by creating an identity penalty model matrix for
 each column regression such that only the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 diagonal element is 0 and all other diagonals are 1.
 This gives priority for the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 regression coefficient in the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 regression model.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{Q}_{i,j}=\begin{cases}
1 & for\, i=j\ne k\\
0 & elsewhere
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

This solution is obtained using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 library in R as the minimization of the penalized squared loss function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\begin_inset Formula $2\times p\times m$
\end_inset

 estimates to a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times m$
\end_inset

 We can think of a column,

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

 as containing the linear combination of regulatory targets of

\end_inset

 that best approximates the regulatory targets of 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{i}$
\end_inset

 in

\end_inset

.
 As one would expect, a large proportion of the matrix 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mass
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be on the diagonal for those TFs which do not change regulatory behavior
 between case and control.
 It is therefore of interest to evaluate values off of the diagonal as indicatio
ns of a network transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we introduce a new concept, differential
\emph on
 transcription factor involvement
\emph default
 (TFI), measured as the standardized sum of squared off-diagonal mass for
 a particular transcription factor.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{j}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}I\left(i\ne j\right)\tau_{i,j}^{2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\tau_{i,j}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

This can be equivalently interpreted as the proportion of the changes in
 edgeweight which is explained by the targeting patterns of all other transcript
ion factors.
 This interpretation highlights a key benefit of this analysis.
 Namely that we are seeking to measure the variability seen in the transition
 in an informative, non-arbitrary manner.
 Essentially, we are focusing only on changes for which there is an attributable
 regulatory pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution of this statistic under the null has a mean and standard
 deviation that varies according to the motif structure.
 In particular, both mean and sd are increased for TFs which have fewer
 prior regulatory targets.
 From a statistical perspective, TFs with relatively more targets are able
 to generate more stable targeted expression patterns, which leads to more
 consistent estimates in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

agreement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 algorithms such as PANDA and BERE.
 From a biological perspective, increased motif presence may indicate that
 the TFs are more likely to be ubiquitous housekeeping proteins that do
 not meaningfully alter their involvement between cases and controls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dependence of the null distribution on the motif structure is addressed
 via resampling.

Results

\begin_layout Standard
A common challenge in gene regulatory network inference is the difficulty
 of validating identified networks against a known, reliable gold standard.
 A number of validation methods have been used for in vivo samples, including
 ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip.
 Knockdowns have also been used in cell lines and have been shown to be
 effective at predicting in vivo responses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, in silico methods have been used which simulate gene expression
 datasets based on a predefined set of regulatory mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since BERE is designed to most accurately refine edges using motif priors,
 it is necessary to combine the edgeweights with the motif priors when comparing
 results with PANDA or SEREND, which use the regulatory prior directly in
 their edgeweight.
 So we generate an 
\emph on
adjusted-BERE
\emph default
 (aBERE), where the priors are added to the edgeweight results to level
 the playing field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test our methods, we used four test datasets of increasing biological
 complexity- (1) in silico, (2) E.
 coli, (3) Yeast, and (4) human.
 Data from the first three sources was obtained from the publicly available
 DREAM5 challenge
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This challenge asked contestants to infer gene networks from expression
 data alone, using a gold standard for evalution.
 Instead, we started with the gold standard and swapped a number of edges
 to create the type I and type II error rates consistent with Yeast motif
 priors and evaluated the performance of BERE to refine its predictions
 of the true gold standard.
 The predictive accuracy of aBERE was comparable to PANDA for each of the
 three smaller organism datasets.

The BERE algorithm offers a computation time orders of magnitudes less than
 PANDA, so we argue its utility particularly for large datasets of analyses
 requiring iterative approaches - such our transition matrix analysis.
 For example, using a standard laptop computer with 4 cores, 8GB RAM and
 2.4 Ghz processor, network construction of 2555 genes, 53 TFs and 106 samples
 took 125 seconds using the R package pandaR.
 Comparatively, an R implementation of BERE run on the same data completes
 in 9 seconds.

Next we ran our complete analysis on data from the ECLIPSE study on Chronic
 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

\end_inset

.
 This dataset consisted of blood sample gene expression assays of 136 COPD
 (case) patients and 84 smoker non-COPD (control) patients.
 Our analysis yielded a list of TFs suspected of differential involvement
 which had high statistical significance.
 Many of the top TFs implicated in the case-control study have also been
 identified independently in different analyses studying the same disease.
 There is growing evidence of a mitochondrial role in COPD which is supported
 by our results.
 In the gene list below, NRF1 and GABPA are both primarily involved in mitochond
rial transcription.

It is of particular interest here to note that only 2 of the 10 TFs listed
 above are significantly differentially expressed (column 
\series bold
gexp
\series default
) between cases and controls at the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.05$
\end_inset

 level.
 This demonstrates that this approach towards identifying changes in TF
 behavior may not be identifiable using conventional microarray analysis
 techniques.
 The transition matrix has the power to observe changes in regulatory behavior
 even if the gene encoding the TF is not measurably changing it's expression
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of the transition matrix approach allows us to further investigate
 our results by exposing the details of the TF shift in involvement.
 We can identify a potential interaction between a 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{i}$
\end_inset

 and a 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

 based on acquisition of regulatory targeting behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{j}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $TF_{i}$
\end_inset

 in transitioning from control to case.
 The plot below is an estimate of the behavioral interactions that we observed
 in COPD.
 We can clearly see that many TFs become involved with other TFs even if
 one of the TFs does not have statistically significant differential TFI.
 This suggests that many regulatory mechanisms may be at play which dictate
 the way in which these proteins interact with each other and the DNA to
 regulate genes.

This graph indicates the manner in which TF gain or lose regulatory features.
 Each visible edge indicates that the parent has gained/lost the features
 of the child in transitioning from Smoker Control to COPD.
 The size of the node indicates the statistical significance of the differential
 TFI, with all visible nodes significant at FDR<.05.
 The width of the edge is also an indication of the strength of significance
 for that interaction.
 Here we see that the TF E2F4 loses the characteristics of FOXD1, HOXC9,
 HLF, SP2 and JUNB as it transitionf from smoker control to COPD.

\begin_layout Standard
A critical point of interest in the problem of differentiating GRNs is confoundi
ng due to measured clinical variables.
 Numerous potential confounders exist in the study of COPD, such as the
 usual covariates age, sex, race, location, socioeconomic level, etc.
 in addition to study-specific confounders such as pack-years and diagnosing
 hospital/physician.
 One approach to account for these variables is to address them at the study
 design level.
 Matching along these covariates would be a sufficient conventional approach.
 However, many data analysis problems do not have the luxury of altering
 study design or practical considerations make it unfeasible to perform
 appropriate matching.

The challenge in of clinical/demographic variable confounding in network
 inference is not straightforward.
 In the case of Gaussian Graphical Models, for example, our observed statistics
 are not individualized measurements which can be adjusted.
 Rather, it is the relative change in conditional gene-gene correlation
 that we are most interested in.
 Thus, we may not simply introduce our confounder into a regression model,
 for example.

Identifying the impact of confounding and properly addressing it would vastly
 increase the utility of the above methods into observational studies.
 The ability to identify the nodes which characterize network transitions
 in the presence of confounding would be a significant step in understanding
 gene regulatory networks.
